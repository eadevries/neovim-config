# Personal Neovim Config
A repository for my personal neovim config to use with the v0.5 nightlies and (presumably) later versions.

Makes use of the newly implemented built-in LSP. As is, requires separate installation of the language servers for the individual languages. In particular, for the Lua LSP, the steps at [https://www.chrisatmachine.com/Neovim/28-neovim-lua-development/](https://www.chrisatmachine.com/Neovim/28-neovim-lua-development/) were followed.
